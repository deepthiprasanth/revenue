## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Work on real life dataset & Improve my Data Visualization and Storytelling skills to provide relevant insights.
- Step 2 : How to read and understand metadata before starting any project (if available) and better understanding of Hospitality domain metrics like DR, Realization, RevPAR, Occupancy, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, etc.
- Step 3 : Data modelling and star schema between the tables.
- Step 4 : Use of calculations, DAX, Calculated Columns, New measures in Power BI.
- Step 5 : If there is a problem and Level 2 Analysis: which process is having the problem.
- Step 6 : How to insert tooltip in dashboard to make them more interactive & descriptive.
- Step 7 : Importance of asking the right Questions to stakeholders to know the expectation as Data Analyst like Why Sales are less? Why pricing is not dynamic? Why some places are under-performing? Why cancellation and ratings are low in some hotels. 

- Step 8 : KPIs / metrics to show if we have achieved our monthly targets.          
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.
